# Introduction

VuePDF is a **client-side** component for **Vue 3** that allows you to flexibly render PDF pages within your project. This library wraps `pdf.js` library so all main features of `pdf.js` are supported by `VuePDF` as well. 

## Installation

```sh
npm i @warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf
yarn add @warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf
```

## Basic Usage

The most basic usage is as simple as import the `VuePDF` and `usePDF` and use them on your project :)

```vue
<script setup>
import { VuePDF, usePDF } from '@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf'

const { pdf } = usePDF('sample.pdf')
</script>

<template>
  <VuePDF :pdf="pdf" />
</template>
```

## Working With Layers

### Text and Annotations

This component supports text selection and annotation interaction by enabling them with `text-layer` and `annotation-layer` props respectively, but for this layers renders correctly is necessary set some `css` styles, it can be done by importing default styles from `@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf/style.css`.

```vue
<script setup>
import { VuePDF, usePDF } from '@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf'
import '@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf/style.css'

const { pdf } = usePDF('sample.pdf')
</script>

<template>
  <VuePDF :pdf="pdf" text-layer annotation-layer />
</template>
```

### XFA Forms
XFA forms also can be supported by enabling them from `usePDF`.

```vue
<script setup>
import { VuePDF, usePDF } from '@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf'
import '@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf/style.css'

const { pdf } = usePDF({
  url: '/xfa.pdf',
  enableXfa: true,
})
</script>

<template>
  <VuePDF :pdf="pdf" />
</template>
```

## Server-Side Rendering

`VuePDF` is a client-side library, so if you are working with a SSR framework like `nuxt`, surely it will throw an error during the building stage, if that is the case, you could wrap `VuePDF` in some sort of "client only" directive or component, also `usePDF` should be wrapped.

## Supporting Non-Latin characters

If you are looking for display non-latin text or you are getting a warning like:
> Warning: Error during font loading: CMapReaderFactory not initialized, see the useWorkerFetch parameter

you will probably need to copy the `cmaps` directory from `node_modules/pdfjs-dist` to your project's `public` directory, don't worry about no having `pdfjs-dist` it's installed alongside `vue-pdf` package.


```
.
â”œâ”€ node_modules
â”‚  â”œâ”€ pdfjs-dist
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ cmaps    <--- Copy this directory
â”œâ”€ src
â”œâ”€ public         
|  â”œâ”€ *cmaps*     <--- Paste it here!
â”œâ”€ package.json
|  ...
```

With that made the `cmaps` will be available on relative path `/cmaps/`, now you need the tell `usePDF` uses that `cmaps` url:

```js
const { pdf } = usePDF({
  url: pdfsource,
  cMapUrl: '/cmaps/',
})
```

## Supporting legacy browsers

If you need to support legacy browsers you could use any polyfill to patch modern functions, but this workaround only works on the **main** thread, the *worker* that runs in other thread will not get reached by any polyfills you apply. 

This package embed and configure the `pdf.js` *worker* for you but in case you need to support legacy environments you will need to configure the `legacy` *worker* by adding this code:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
+ import * as PDFJS from 'pdfjs-dist'; 
+ import LegacyWorker from 'pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.worker.min?url'; 
import { VuePDF, usePDF } from '@warp10-pauloschussler/vue-pdf';

+ PDFJS.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = LegacyWorker 

const { pdf } = usePDF(/** */)
</script>
```

Just be aware to set the `legacy` worker before use `usePDF`.

## Common issues

### Promise.withResolvers

> Promise.withResolvers is not a function

That throws because `Promise.withResolvers` is a relative "new feature" of JavaScript's Promises, even if almost all browsers [support it](https://caniuse.com/?search=withResolvers), in NodeJS this feature was fully included on version v22 as a base feature. To solve this issue consider updating node version if you are currently using a lower one.

### Top-level await is not available in the configured target environment

> [ERROR] Top-level await is not available in the configured target environment ("chrome87", "edge88", "es2020", "firefox78", "safari14" + 2 overrides)

This error is more related to ESBuild settings instead of compatibility matters, `Top-level await` is (as usually) a "new feature" of the JavaScript definition, practically all browsers [support it](https://caniuse.com/?search=top-level%20await) and was included on NodeJS since v14.

To solve this issue you will need to add this settings on `vite.config`:

```js
optimizeDeps: {
  esbuildOptions: {
    supported: {
      'top-level-await': true,
    },
  },
},
esbuild: {
  supported: {
    'top-level-await': true,
  },
}
```
